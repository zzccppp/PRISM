I am a PhD student in Computer Science, Harbin Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. Yang Liu.

I completed my undergraduate studies at Harbin Institute of Technology, majoring in Information Security. I then obtained a Master’s degree from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in the Data Science and Machine Learning programme.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning, Graph Neural Networks, Generative Models, and their applications in various domains such as social networks, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics.
